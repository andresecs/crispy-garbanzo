    ```

### Groups 
Depending on the **Status** of the Employee, **Listserv** selected, and **Advanced SharePoint Access** check, they will be added/removed from the following groups:

| Group | Status | Listserv | Advanced SharePoint Access |
| ----- | ------ | -------- | -------------------------- |
| **Adds to** | 
| Full-time | Active | Full-time | | 
| Part-time | Active | Part-time | | 
| Student   | Active | Student   | |  
| Advanced SharePoint | Active | | Yes | 
| **Removes from** | 
| Full-time | Inactive | Full-time | | 
| Part-time | Inactive | Part-time | | 
| Student   | Inactive | Student   | |  
| Advanced SharePoint | Inactive | | No | 
*Note: blank columns mean that the value in the column is irrelevant.* 


### Other Effects

**Staff Availability**

Whenever staff create new availability for themselves, they look up their name using a dropdown. The dropdown values are pulled directly from the Employee Record System. Therefore, **if the employee is not registered in the ERS, they will not be able to add their availability.**

**Radio Assignments**

Whenever radios get assigned to staff, the Radio Database uses an Employee Name dropdown to link the employee to the radio. The dropdown values from Employee Name are pulled directly from the Employee Record System. Therefore, **if the employee is not registered in the ERS, they will not be found when assigning a radio.**
